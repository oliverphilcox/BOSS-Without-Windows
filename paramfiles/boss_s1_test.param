### Parameter file for the BOSS SGC z1 dataset
# NB: This is strictly for testing purposes only. It uses a small fraction of the data, low resolution, and few MC realization for speed.

# Input data, and column labels
# If multiple simulations are used, the data file-name should contain "%d", which will be replaced by the simulation number.
# If only one simulation is used, no "%d" should be included, and the simulation-number should be set to -1.
